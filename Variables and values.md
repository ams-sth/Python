Variables and values are key concepts of programming languages. Every programming languages such as python, javascript, C and C++, java etc are built using them as foundation.

## What is a variable ?
Variable is a method of accessing memory location of a RAM in order to store values.

**For example:**
    x = 32
    Here, x is a variable.
        32 is an value.

Since python is a dynamically typed laguage, it doesn't require data type declaration.

## What is a value ?
Values are data that is stored in variables for further actions. These actions can be as simple as printing output to as complex as performing complex calculations.

Variable names can be different and will not have any impact on outcome. The value is what determines the outcome.

**For example:** 
    a = 1
    print (a)

The *output* will be 1. The variable `a` can be replaced by other words such as b, number, etc and the outcome will still be same.  However, if the value 1 is replaced by `2` then the outcome will be 2.

Variables also identifies values through their data type.
